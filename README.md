# Scoundrel
Scoundrel is a single player rogue-like card game for use with a standard deck of playing cards. It was developed by Zack Gage and Kurt Bieg for Train Jam 2011.

The game only enforces the rules but does really little for you if you don't understand how to play.

You get a Room from the deck. A room are 4 cards. To move to the next room you can either face the room (pick 3 cards) or run (shuffle and get 4 new cards), but you can't run from two rooms in a row. 
Hearts will heal you for the face value. Diamonds are weapons that hit for the face value. Black cards (Clubs and Spades) are enemies. 
The damage you take from an enemy is the difference between your weapon value and the enemy face value (Your fists count as a zero value). 
Be careful, using your weapon on an enemy makes it duller and it can only kill an enemy with a lower face value than the previous one.

The official rules can be found here.
